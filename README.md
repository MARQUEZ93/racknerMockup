* Mockup the attached design using HTML and CSS (and optionally react).
* You can use React if you want, but it's not a requirement.
* Some parts of this may be more simple to do in React.  
* The design does not need to be interactive in any way.
* Colors and fonts/font weights are not important at all.
* Ideally, make use of Flexbox.
* The design does not need to be responsive to screen size.
